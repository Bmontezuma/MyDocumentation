# ***Comments***

A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.

## ***Single-line Comments***
Single-line comments are created using two consecutive forward slashes. The compiler ignores any text after // on the same line.
```java
// This line will denote a comment in C++

Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments are created using /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment. The compiler ignores any text in between.

/*
This is all commented out.
None of it is going to run!
*/
```

## ***Codebyte Example***
Here’s a program with a multi-line comment and two single-line comments:
```java

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Calculate the tip
  double total = 18.75;
  double tip = total * 0.2;
```
